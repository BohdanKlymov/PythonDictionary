# Cinema simulation with Python Dictionaries

This repository contains a small Python project designed to help practice and improve skills with dictionaries (dict). The project simulates a mini cinema in the console, allowing users to interact with a simple movie booking system.


Key features of the project include:

Adding new movies with available seats and ticket prices

Viewing a list of all movies, including movies added by the user

Booking tickets and showing the total cost for the reservation

Returning booked tickets and updating the availability

Storing all movie data in a dictionary that is modified dynamically


The main goal of this project is to practice working with dictionaries, including adding, updating, and reading nested dictionary data, while building an interactive console application.
